👋 Hi! I'm Tomás Darquier, and I've recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, earning a 10/10 on my thesis. After five years of learning and exploration, I'm excited to keep growing and tackling new challenges in the field.

## About Me 🧑‍💻
Since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by the world of computing and the endless possibilities of what can be achieved with a computer. I'm particularly interested in how things work behind the abstractions we interact with daily, which led me to deepen my self-taught studies in back-end development—something I continue to explore today. Additionally, I delved into front-end development to provide end users with access to everything I build.

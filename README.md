👋 Hi! I'm Tomás Darquier, and I'm about to complete my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The only step left is the oral defense of my final thesis, marking the end of this journey I started five years ago.

## About Me 🧑‍💻
Since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by the world of computing and the endless possibilities of what can be achieved with a computer. I'm particularly interested in how things work behind the abstractions we interact with daily, which led me to deepen my self-taught studies in back-end development—something I continue to explore today. Additionally, I delved into front-end development to provide end users with access to everything I build.
